          <p>
            The term &ldquo;internet artwork&rdquo; encompasses many -artistic
            avenues that make it a broad term. Internet Artwork uses the
            internet as the main medium and/or subject. Internet artworks
            include digital art, net art, interactive installations, videos, and
            VR experiences (virtual reality) (Nasution and Nusa, 2021). Art
            often focuses on the medium, technology, identity, the internet, and
            its impact. It's often created using different tools and techniques,
            specifically coding, animation, and social media. Internet art is a
            reflection of a constantly and ever-evolving medium as technology
            updates faster and faster. (Micchelli and Carrier, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet has created a new way of creating art, people are now
            able to display their art without the aid of a museum or gallery.
            Art from many who would have never been seen before can now be
            found, and the emergence of interactive and net art that can be
            experienced online. Digital tools and software have made it so that
            one it so new art skills are introduced such as manipulation of
            other media. People now also have access to platforms and other
            media to create their art such as geographic platforms as well as
            being able to not have geographic boundaries in sharing art
            (Micchelli and Carrier, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>Concept &ndash; Women&rsquo;s bodies and the online ethos</p>
          <p>
            The website that will be critically analysed is called &ldquo;Body
            Anxiety.&rdquo; It is an artwork that speaks on the sexualisation
            and objectification of women&rsquo;s bodies. The website contains
            images of women and their thoughts on gender and being perceived and
            objectified. This is seen as a way to reclaim their bodies as it is
            a female-centred piece and the projects within the website are from
            women themselves. <em>Body Anxiety</em> examines how artists
            perceive gender embodiment, performance and self-representation
            online. The website refers to the fact that the female body has been
            used throughout art and film history as nude from the perspective
            and view of male-authored work. The majority of the time the work is
            capitalising off of women&rsquo;s bodies and their voices are
            silenced. The website references the seventies when women were seen
            reclaiming their bodies through art and women-centred work in videos
            and performances. As of recent times in the digital age, the
            internet is used by artists as a platform to create and share their
            imagery. Digital technologies have made it possible for gender-queer
            performative space for artists to question femininity and
            investigate it. This website by Schrager and Chan displays a
            collection of &ldquo;female empowering artworks&rdquo; to help
            combat the existing narratives of gender (&ldquo;About,&rdquo;
            n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>They provide these two quotes on their page:</p>
          <p>
            <em>
              &ldquo;Whenever body online, in some way you are in conversation
              with porn.&rdquo;
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>-</em>Ann Hirsch (&ldquo;Landing,&rdquo; n.d.)
          </p>
          <p>As well as the other quote:</p>
          <p>
            <em>
              &ldquo;This is painful: no matter how many levels of consciousness
              one reaches, the problem always goes deeper. It is
              everywhere&rdquo;
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>-Shulamite Firestone(&ldquo;Landing,&rdquo; n.d.)</p>
          <p>
            Susan Fiske found that when women are wearing bikinis they are less
            likely to be viewed as human and rather objects, however, this did
            not occur for women whom they knew personally and were related such
            as mothers. This insinuates only men can be &ldquo;slutty&rdquo;
            whereas men do not. This objectification of women did not arise from
            just anywhere but rather from the deeply ingrained pornography and
            patriarchal systems in the world. The way that the world is
            sex-divided, gender-focused public spaces, and on the web. Once the
            world views you as a female you are treated like one. Like an object
            (&ldquo;How We Become Objects,&rdquo; n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of the internet, women and queer bodies have a
            space to speak to one another and reinvent and interrogate sexual
            identities, however, the internet also has its downsides as
            women&rsquo;s bodies are seen as automatically free to scrutinize.
            This is due to women&rsquo;s bodies being &lsquo;pornified,&rsquo;
            and women&rsquo;s bodies become public property (&ldquo;How We
            Become Objects,&rdquo; n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet allows for the coming together of communities, allowing
            for the aforementioned marginalised groups of people to meet with
            like-minded people and learn about expressing themselves,
            specifically within queer communities (Lupton, 2014). This website
            using the internet as its medium is somewhat counterproductive to
            its cause however, it does bring to light how intrinsically linked
            patriarchy is in society, systems and institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to real life, in online spaces, women lose their ability to
            give consent and have to become subjects and objects. The website
            provides a piece of writing by someone named &ldquo;Jennifer&rdquo;
            who recounts their first time seeing a woman&rsquo;s body being
            commodified. Seeing pornographic ads as a tween only leads to the
            darker hole of what is presented as non-consensual porn such as
            &ldquo;hidden-cam porn.&rdquo; She believed she would not be able to
            live, go out and be a person without herself becoming a victim in
            one of those videos. This begs the question of, can women&rsquo;s
            bodies exist while being respected. Can a woman&rsquo;s body have
            value without it being of interest to men? The fact that
            women&rsquo;s bodies are removed from consciousness and
            &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo; for entertainment leads to this website.
            Body anxiety (&ldquo;How We Become Objects,&rdquo; n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            The website contains 21 women providing images that they desire to
            place on the internet to portray their bodies in the way they want.
            Whether it is to express their concerns with how their bodies are
            viewed online using poems, edited/manipulated images, or just their
            bodies and pictures of themselves. With consent. In one image, the
            artist refers to herself as a &ldquo;networker,&rdquo; a play on
            &lsquo;sex worker&rsquo; as she knows men are sexually viewing
            bodies online. The website emphasises on reclaiming bodily autonomy
            as one user, Aurorae Parker provides a poem on this desire to exist
            outside of a one-dimensional view. She makes use of text shorthand
            by replacing certain sounds with equivalent numbers (create becomes
            &ldquo;cre8&rdquo;, to/too becomes &ldquo;2&rdquo; ), one can see
            this as a way of using the internet as the subject and the medium as
            she uses something often only seen online and speaks on the negative
            impacts the internet has had on female bodies (&ldquo;Aurorae Parker
            (info),&rdquo; n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            One artist provides a diary entry where she details men&rsquo;s
            commodification of women&rsquo;s bodies, describing it as men
            relying on others' labour for their artistic endeavours. Only women
            suffer when they have to put in the emotional and mental labour to
            view their bodies as theirs when men use them as props in art
            pieces. She gives us one encompassing word,
            &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; (&ldquo;Randon Rosenbohm (info),&rdquo;
            n.d.). She provides their Tumblr page, &ldquo;My Rejected
            Selfies,&rdquo; to show the unpopular photos of themselves that they
            posted online, the majority of which are just her face and never in
            what would be considered a sexual context. This is to insinuate that
            these are unpopular as they do not cater to the desired view of men
            online (&ldquo;Randon Rosenbohm (info),&rdquo; n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            One question that arises from this website is, how come this
            non-consensual objectification of women is accepted and allowed
            online? This can be attributed to the newness of digital
            technologies where discourse, niche conversations and long-term
            effects are unknown. The internet hasn&rsquo;t been around for long
            enough for people to be aware of its effects, therefore, many laws
            and regulations are missing (Zuboff, 2019).
          </p>
          <p>Aesthetics</p>
          <p>
            Aesthetics stems from philosophy regarding art and beauty, it also
            deals with the appreciation of creation and beauty outside of
            one&rsquo;s taste. It interrogates the ways of creating something
            that is both visually and emotionally stimulating, why it appeals to
            viewers and how it communicates that. Aesthetics are both subjective
            and objective, things like personal taste and cultural practices
            come into play regarding what is beautiful. There is also a field
            dedicated to the study called visual arts where aesthetics (Graham,
            2005).
          </p>
          <p>
            The website has a very simple aesthetic that is reminiscent of an
            art gallery as it is simply a collection of images that the user can
            browse at their own pace by different artists and users can skip to
            whichever artist they desire to look at. The website works in a
            slideshow-like way where the user has to click to go to the next
            project. The website is majority off white and has simple black text
            with a consistent font. This simplicity is to show off each project,
            nothing becomes hard to read or view because of it.
          </p>
          <p>Conclusion</p>
          <p>
            The use of the internet as a platform for this website allows for
            multiple women especially women of colour to display the art of
            their bodies as bodies of colour open a completely new door of
            discourse in the conversation of objectification and sexualisation.
            Using the internet as a medium allows for crossing geographic
            boundaries for those to view your art as well as artists to display
            theirs. This has become somewhat of a memorialised art piece because
            of the nature of the internet and how nothing is ever lost online.
            These artists' voices and art pieces will never deteriorate or be
            lost, and their words and images will forever spread their desired
            message of body anxiety. Not only Is the internet the medium but
            also the subject, the website provides a written piece detailing the
            experience of tween girls online and pornography, not only does this
            allow users to see how women view their bodies as objects but it
            also opens one&rsquo;s eyes to how early boys are exposed to online
            porn. This website is a women-centred piece that allows women to
            display their art in a way that they desire regarding their bodies
            and their objectification by men. The page's aesthetics are very
            simple, so the focus is majorly on the art and voices of women.
            Something that has been overlooked for millennia. The website uses
            something that can be seen as a weapon against women, the internet,
            and creates an art gallery for bodies and different bodies instead.
